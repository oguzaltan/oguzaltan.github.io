Education
======
* M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, Information Technology and Computer Engineering at RWTH Aachen University, 2023
* M.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University, 2020

Experience
======

* Master’s Thesis at Fraunhofer FKIE & INDA at RWTH Aachen University
  * Title: Tracking and Evasion using Co-Training with Context Knowledge
  * Researched UAV trajectory optimization for precise target tracking in urban environments. 
  * Developed a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning system with game-theoretic co-training and procedural map generation. 
  * Demonstrated improved agent contextual awareness in urban environments, enabling effective tracking and evasion behaviors.
  * Supervisors: Prof. Dr.-Ing. Anke Schmeink and Dr. Alexander Charlish

* Machine Learning Engineering Intern and Working Student at Siemens AG
  * Conducted research and development in anomaly detection for the AI-integrated Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAMAI) process, by implementing and evaluating various machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
  * Based on F1 and PR AUC scores, found that CNN-based autoencoders perform best in detecting anomalies in WAAMAI process data.
  * Supervisors: Dr.-Ing. Raven Thomas Reisch and Dr. Philip Howell

* Research and Engineering Intern at Fraunhofer IIS | FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg
  * Redesigned and programmed wireless embedded systems, which are used by members and undergraduate students of the IoT and Embedded Electronics teams of FAU Erlangen-N¨urnberg and Fraunhofer IIS.
  * Supervisors: Sally Nafie, M. Sc.

* Seminar Paper at Institute for Man-Machine Interaction at RWTH Aachen University
  * Title: Mobile Robotics in Disaster Scenarios
  * Written within the scope of seminar course <em>Current Concepts and Trends in Robotics and Simulation Science<em>.
  * Supervisor: David Böken, M. Sc.

* Bachelor’s Final Project at Bilkent University
  * Title: Accompanying Humans and Achieving Designated Tasks with Autonomous Mobile Robots
  * Developed an autonomous land robot with ROS, featuring LIDAR and YOLO for object tracking. 
  * The robot tracks humans, evades obstacles, and ensures smooth traversal across diverse terrains. 
  * Conducted simulations in ROS with Gazebo integration to validate system performance.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Aykut Koc

* Research and Engineering Intern at TUBITAK Space Technologies Research Institute
  * Designed a circuit for transmitting analog signals through a noisy medium, and implemented analog-to-digital signal conversion. Through simulation tools, validated that the output signal exhibits minimal noise.
