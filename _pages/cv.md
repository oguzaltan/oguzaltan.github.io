Experience
======

* **Robotics Researcher / Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter at the [University of Applied Sciences (FHDW) Paderborn](https://www.fhdw.de/en), 2024-Present**
  * Title: **SilvaBot - Fully Autonomous Robot for Scalable, Climate-Change-Adapted Forest Conversion**
  * Autonomously reforesting areas affected by climate change and wildfires through **ground and aerial robots** using **swarm intelligence**.
  * Research and development of **robotics software architectures**, focusing on **swarm behavior, multi-sensor fusion, task and motion planning, navigation, mapping, perception**, and **obstacle avoidance algorithms** for autonomous ground and aerial robots operating in **dynamic environments**.
  <!-- * Demonstrated improved agent contextual awareness in urban environments, enabling effective tracking and evasion behaviors. -->
  * Supervisor: [Prof. Dr. Wil­helm Nü­ßer](https://www.fhdw.de/hochschulteam/n%C3%BC%C3%9Fer)

* **[Master's Thesis](https://github.com/oguzaltan/Tracking-and-Evasion-using-Co-Training-with-Context-Knowledge) at Fraunhofer FKIE & INDA at RWTH Aachen University, 2023**
  * Title: **Tracking and Evasion using Co-Training with Context Knowledge**
  * Researched **UAV trajectory optimization** for **precise target tracking** in urban environments.
  * Developed a **multi-agent deep reinforcement learning** system with **game-theoretic co-training**, implemented **procedural map generation** to produce urban map images, and integrated a **CNN model into RL pipeline** to leverage map images as a set observations for agents. 
  <!-- * Demonstrated improved agent contextual awareness in urban environments, enabling effective tracking and evasion behaviors. -->
  * Supervisors: [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Anke Schmeink](https://www.inda.rwth-aachen.de/cms/INDA/Die-Organisationseinheit/Team/~bgmvjw/Anke-Schmeink/lidx/1/) and [Dr. Alexander Charlish](https://www.inda.rwth-aachen.de/cms/INDA/Die-Organisationseinheit/Team/~bgmuwy/Alexander-Charlish/lidx/1/)

* **Machine Learning Engineering Intern and Working Student at Siemens AG, 2022**
  * Conducted research and development in **anomaly detection** for the **AI-integrated Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAMAI)** process, by implementing and evaluating various machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
  * Based on **F1** and **PR AUC** scores, found that **CNN-based autoencoders** perform best in detecting anomalies in WAAMAI process data.
  * Supervisors: [Dr.-Ing. Raven Thomas Reisch](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=HBc4t6QAAAAJ&hl=de) and [Dr. Philip Howell](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/colleges/eps/eps-community/alumni-profiles-new/physics-astronomy/philip-howell)

* **[Seminar Paper](https://github.com/oguzaltan/Mobile_Robotics_in_Disaster_Scenarios) at Institute for Man-Machine Interaction at RWTH Aachen University, 2021**
  * Title: **Mobile Robotics in Disaster Scenarios**
  * Written within the scope of seminar course *Current Concepts and Trends in Robotics and Simulation Science*.
  * Supervisor: [David Böken, M. Sc.](https://www.mmi.rwth-aachen.de/)

* **[Bachelor’s Final Project](https://github.com/oguzaltan/Tag-A-Long-Robot) at Bilkent University, 2020**
  * Title: **Accompanying Humans and Achieving Designated Tasks with Autonomous Mobile Robots**
  * Developed an **autonomous land robot** with **ROS**, featuring **LIDAR** and **YOLO** for **object tracking**. The robot **tracks humans**, **evades obstacles**, and **ensures smooth traversal across diverse terrains**. Conducted simulations in **ROS** with **Gazebo** integration to validate system performance.
  * Supervisor: [Dr. Aykut Koc](http://aykut.koc.bilkent.edu.tr/)

* **Research and Engineering Intern at Fraunhofer IIS, 2019**
  * **Redesigned** and **programmed** **wireless embedded systems**, which are used by members and undergraduate students of the *IoT and Embedded Electronics teams of FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg and Fraunhofer IIS*.
  * Supervisor: [Sally Nafie, M. Sc.](https://www.like.tf.fau.de/person/m-sc-sally-nafie/)

* **Research and Engineering Intern at TUBITAK Space Technologies Research Institute, 2018**
  * Designed a circuit for **transmitting analog signals through a noisy medium**, and implemented **analog-to-digital signal conversion**. Through simulation tools, validated that the output signal exhibits **minimal noise**.
